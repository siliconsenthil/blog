At Simpl, we faced a challenge to run a polyglot microservices based platform in auto-scalable and secure manner. We did not have dedicated DevOps person. We could not go ahead with a PaaS solution for lack of customizability. So we built our own solution called [cloudlift](https://github.com/GetSimpl/cloudlift). I and [Jeechu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeechudeka/) presented this at multiple meetups.
